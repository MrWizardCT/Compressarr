; Inno Setup script for Compressarr - a tray-only background app with its entire UI in the
; browser (Radarr/Sonarr-style). Builds TWO installer variants from one script, sharing all the
; upgrade-safety logic below so it can never drift out of sync between them:
;
;   Non-bundled (default): packages the framework-dependent win-x64 publish output (requires the
;   matching .NET ASP.NET Core Runtime already installed on the target machine - see README):
;     dotnet publish src/Compressarr.Desktop -c Release -r win-x64 -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0 --self-contained false -o publish/win-x64-fx
;     ISCC.exe installer\Compressarr.iss
;     -> publish\Compressarr-Setup-{version}.exe
;
;   Full (bundled): packages the self-contained win-x64 publish output (bundles its own .NET
;   runtime, no separate install needed, much larger):
;     dotnet publish src/Compressarr.Desktop -c Release -r win-x64 -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0 --self-contained true -o publish/win-x64-full
;     ISCC.exe /DFULL installer\Compressarr.iss
;     -> publish\Compressarr-Setup-{version}-Full.exe
;
; The Full variant was dropped entirely as of 2.1.1 (2026-09-05) after Windows Defender's live
; cloud/SmartScreen reputation classifier (Program:Win32/Contebrew.A!ml) flagged a real download -
; a live heuristic VirusTotal's static engine never reproduced (it scanned the identical file 0/68
; clean, Microsoft's own engine included), so a clean VT scan alone was never proof either way. The
; self-signed cert used at the time carried zero publisher reputation, which the classifier weighs
; alongside file size/novelty. **Reinstated 2026-09-07** after switching to a real Azure Trusted
; Signing certificate (see the compressarr-azure-signing-setup memory) - the user tested BOTH
; variants with a live Defender scan on a real production machine (the same way Contebrew was
; originally caught) and both came back clean, real first-hand evidence the reputation issue was
; actually about publisher trust, not the bundling itself. Both variants now ship every release,
; using the SAME AppId (below) so installing either one over the other is treated as a normal
; upgrade/reinstall of the same product, not a separate side-by-side install.
;
; Both variants use the SAME [Code] upgrade-safety logic (InitializeSetup/PrepareToInstall/
; [InstallDelete] below) - critical since a user can switch FROM either variant TO either variant,
; and the self-contained build's own coreclr.dll/hostfxr.dll left behind by an in-place upgrade is
; exactly the failure mode that logic exists to prevent (see its own comments for the full story).

[InstallDelete]

; upgrading a self-contained install (which bundles coreclr.dll/hostfxr.dll/hostpolicy.dll
; directly in {app}) to this framework-dependent build left those runtime files behind, and
; .NET's host detects a local coreclr.dll as "this is a self-contained app" - it then searches
; for the runtime INSIDE {app} instead of the real machine-wide install, failing with "You must
; install or update .NET" even though the correct runtime is genuinely installed system-wide.
