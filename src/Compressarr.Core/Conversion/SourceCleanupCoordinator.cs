/// The "tell Sonarr/Radarr, confirm the rescan, only then remove the empty source folder" sequence that a
/// finished file goes through - used by the first attempt (ProcessOneFileAsync) and by all three kinds of
/// retry (RetryRecovery). The ORDER is the safety rule this app has been burned by before: if the source
/// folder is already gone when Sonarr/Radarr rescans, it reads as a disconnected root and never clears the
/// episode; and a rescan that never confirmed it finished can't prove it saw the folder at all. So the folder
/// is only removed after a positively-confirmed rescan, and a failure of either step is never swallowed -
/// callers keep the entry alive (CleanupPending) so it is retried.
///
/// Each caller used to carry its own copy of these two try/catch blocks, differing only in the wording of
/// the log lines and in what it did with the result; the wording is preserved through the
/// <c>context</c> argument so nothing the user reads has changed.
