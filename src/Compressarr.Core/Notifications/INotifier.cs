/// chat ID, etc.) - the web UI fetches these via GET /api/notifications/types and renders whatever
/// each registered INotifier declares, so adding a new channel type never needs new frontend
/// code. InputType is "text"/"password"/"textarea"/"select" - Options is only meaningful (and
/// required) for "select". HelpText drives a hover/focus help bubble next to the field's label.
/// Placeholder is example-format grey hint text shown inside an empty field - use it for anything
/// whose exact shape is per-user/per-account (a Discord webhook URL, a self-hosted server address)
/// where there's no real value to pre-fill. DefaultValue is different: a REAL starting value
/// applied when a new channel of this type is created, appropriate only for a field with a genuine
/// shared public default (e.g. ntfy's Server field defaulting to the public ntfy.sh instance) -
/// never use it for something that merely looks similar across users but isn't actually shared.</summary>
